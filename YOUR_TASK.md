# Your Task

This task is quite simple. 

#### Part 1
Make sure you have set up your Git settings on your local computer, as explained in the [README.md](./README.md)

#### Part 2
Clone this repo to your computer using VSCode (instructions are in [README.md](./README.md)). 

#### Part 3
1. Edit the `README.md` file and add your name to the very top of it.
    - Preview your changes (right-click the README.md file in the file list and select preview)
2. Create a new file named `index.html`
3. Inside this new file, copy and paste: `<h1>This is a heading!</h1>`
    - Preview your work on this file as well
4. _Commit_ your changes to make a snapshot of the code.
5. Synchronize your changes up to GitHub (this is called a _push_).
6. Go back to your repo on GitHub.com and verify the changes.
